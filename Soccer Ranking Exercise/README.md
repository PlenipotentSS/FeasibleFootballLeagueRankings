### FeasibleFootballLeagueRankings

A Command Line tool that utilizes games stored in a well-formed text file and converts them into a ranking. 

There are two current builds in this repo. The Xcode project is dependent on xcode to run. This is the testing environment that utilizes XCTest class to unit test the different models of this project.

The second build is a command line application stored in /usr/local/bin/FeasibleFootballLeagueRankings

This second build can be run from command line and is more appropriate for access local files.

Rooms for improvement: The application can easily be converted to full command line tool that inputs the reading and writing files paths in a single line. For testing and showcasing purposes, I decided to keep the command line interaction.
